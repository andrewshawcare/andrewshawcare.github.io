# Hosting a retrospective

Reflect meaningfully, act intentionally

## Notes

Hello again!

Today we're going to discuss the power of retrospectives for creating change and improvement, whether individually or as a team. Simply put, retrospectives are a tool for reflection and intentional action, fostering an environment of continuous improvement.

## Why retrospectives?

## Notes

Our journey with retrospectives begins by understanding their importance.

Our primary goal is to create a feedback loop that turns discussion into improvement.

For teams, ensuring an atmosphere of open dialogue will help foster meaningful group discussion.

## Structure

* Mandatory
  * The prime directive
  * Safety check
* Everything else:
  * Make it interesting
  * Keep what works

## Notes

Moving on, let's explore the structure of a retrospective.

Two key activities include reading the prime directive and conducting a safety check.

There's many ways to structure the rest of the retrospective and we'll go through an example. What's important is to make the activities interesting and to keep what works for you or your team.

## The prime directive

> Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand. â€” Norm Kerth

## Notes

Starting off, the prime directive sets the tone for what could (and should!) be critical reflection.

Individuals and experiences should be separated so that we can focus on the experience and what we can change for our team to improve in the future.

## Safety check

* A [quick check](https://www.funretrospectives.com/safety-check/) to gauge the team's willingness to share critical feedback.

* A low safety score requires pivoting from the retrospective into a [safety building activity](https://www.funretrospectives.com/creating-safety/).

## Notes

Up next, the safety check.

Feeling unsafe about sharing critical feedback will inhibit the benefits of a retrospective before it begins.

This activity can be quick if things are feeling good, but focus on safety if it's in jeopardy.

## Notes

A nice addition to your retro is the health check.

A health check survey can provide context to focus reflection.

A tool like the one linked here can get you started.

## Reflect

## Notes

The first major activity is reflection.

Usually this means writing stickies on a categorized retrospective board.

An example of common categories for reflection are, "Went well", "To improve", and, "Questions."

Reflection should be anonymous and time-boxed.

## Clarify

</figcaption>

## Notes

Clarification follows, and is used to quickly clear up confusion.

Read each sticky and allow time for team members to ask what a confusing sticky means. The person who created the sticky can help clarify.

Once an explanation is provided, quickly move on.

You can also group related stickies here.

## Notes

Next is the voting stage, which aims to prioritize issues democratically. We will use these votes to aid in the discussion that follows.

## Discuss

## Notes

The discussion phase targets the issues that received the most votes.

Effective moderation here ensures goal-oriented conversations, time management, and active participation.

## Notes

 Finally, remediation is about action items that capture ideas for productive change.
 
 Create accountability by ensuring individual ownership and make sure to review of items from the previous retrospectives.

## Notes

In conclusion, retrospectives act as a vehicle for improvement through discussion.

Remember, the idea is simple yet profound: Discuss, change, test, and improve. This is the feedback loop that retrospectives are designed to instigate and sustain.

Give it a try, and watch your team adapt and evolve.

Thanks!
