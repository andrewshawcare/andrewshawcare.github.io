Fleeting notes record thoughts as they happen.

Later they are compiled into [permanent notes](./permanent-notes.md) and discarded.

The etymology of _fleeting_:

> early 13c., "fickle, shifting, unstable," from Old English _fleotende_ "floating, drifting," later "flying, moving swiftly," from present participle of _fleotan_ "to float, drift, flow" (see **fleet** (v.)). Meaning "existing only briefly" is from 1560s. [1]

_Shifting, unstable._ A thought from the past does not carry the same meaning in the present. Memory is imperfect and imaginative. Supporting context may be lost.

_Floating, drifting._ We do not choose which thoughts enter our consciousness and have little influence on when they make their exit.

_Flying, moving swiftly._ Perception of thoughts relies on attention and memory. Attend to useful thoughts before they are lost.
