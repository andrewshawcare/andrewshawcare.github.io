A fleeting note records a thought shortly after having it.

The etymology of _fleeting_:

> early 13c., "fickle, shifting, unstable," from Old English _fleotende_ "floating, drifting," later "flying, moving swiftly," from present participle of _fleotan_ "to float, drift, flow" (see **fleet** (v.)). Meaning "existing only briefly" is from 1560s. [1]

_Shifting, unstable._ A thought from the past does not carry the same meaning in the present. Memory is imperfect and imaginative. Supporting context may be lost.

_Floating, drifting._ We do not choose our thoughts. We have little control over how we attend to them.

_Flying, moving swiftly._ Attention and meaning combine into thought. Perception shifts our attention forward. New meaning is identified.

_Existing only briefly._ Thoughts stay with us for as long as attention and memory allow.
