A good request has an objective outcome, practical constraints, and orienting context.

In order to fulfill a request it is important to understand why the request is useful. This [context](./context/) focuses attention, defines meaning, and directs action.

Come to terms with the author of the request. Clarity removes [ambiguity](./ambiguity/) in terms and, ultimately, ambiguity in the outcome.
