A good request has an objective outcome, practical constraints, and orienting context.

It is important to understand why a request is useful. [Context](./context/) focuses attention, defines meaning, and directs action.

One who enacts a request must understand it with the same meaning as the author. [Terms](./terms/) define unambiguous meaning.
