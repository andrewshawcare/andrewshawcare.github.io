> What is at stake?

## Immediate

The direct effect of reaching an outcome.

* What changes instantly upon success or failure?
* Who is affected first by our outcome?
* What processes activate or shut down?
* How quickly do effects manifest?

## Cumulative

How impacts cascade from our outcome.

* What reactions follow success or failure?
* How do effects propagate differently in each case?
* What downstream changes occur?
* Who is indirectly affected?

## Success

What follows from achieving our goal.

* What positive changes occur?
* What new opportunities are gained?
* What obligations are created?
* What maintenance is required?

## Failure

What follows from missing our goal.

* What problems persist or worsen?
* What opportunities are lost?
* What trust or credibility is damaged?
* What alternatives must we pursue?

## Inconclusive

What follows from unclear results.

* What happens with mixed results?
* Which consequences are binary vs. gradual?
* How do stakeholders react to mixed results?
* What gets salvaged or written off?

## Implications

What follows regardless of outcome.

* What future options open or close?
* What precedents are set?
* How does this affect future attempts?
* What can't be undone?
* What do we learn regardless of outcome?
