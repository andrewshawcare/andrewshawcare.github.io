title: Constraints
---

A request requires activities to transition from an initial state to a goal state.

We must constrain our activity based on our perception of the available resources:

* Performing an activity has an estimated potential cost.
* Completing an activity has an estimated potential reward.
* Once we complete an activity we know the actual cost of performing it and the actual reward of completing it.
* The cost and reward of activities without dependencies are easier to estimate than activities that are dependent on others. 
* We can only act as long as we can afford the cost of action.
