> If success is challenged, what evidence could defend it?

## Quantitative

Measures that indicate goal achievement.

* What metrics would determine success?
* What metric values do we need to achieve success?
* What thresholds define acceptable outcomes?
* How do we measure progress toward these metrics?

## Qualitative

Signs that we have achieved our goal.

* What behaviors or conditions will we observe when we succeed?
* What stakeholder responses would indicate success?
* What will be different about our environment?
* What new capabilities will exist?

## Approval

Who confirms success and how they decide.

* Who determines if we've met our goal?
* What is the evaluation process?
* What evidence do they need to see?
* When will evaluation occur?
* Can approval be revoked or reassessed?

## Validation

How we prove we meet the criteria.

* How do we verify we've met criteria?
* What tests or assessments apply?
* Who conducts the validation?
* What constitutes sufficient proof?

## Variance

The spectrum between failure and success.

* What constitutes partial success?
* Which criteria are required and which are optional?
* What's the minimum viable success?
* How do we handle mixed results?

## Durability

When success is measured and how long it must last.

* By when must criteria be met?
* How long must success conditions persist?
* Are there different criteria for different timeframes?
* What defines sustainable vs. temporary success?
