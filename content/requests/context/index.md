title: Context

Context helps understand the landscape of a request and our place within it.

We must know the [consequence](./consequence.md) of the request to know it's value.

We must get our [bearings](./bearings.md) to orient our path to the goal.

We must define [boundaries](./boundaries.md) to determine where the path may lie.

We must define [constraints](./constraints.md) to govern our action.
