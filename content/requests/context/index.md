Context helps understand the landscape of a request and our role within it.

## Environmental

The landscape and how it changes over time.

* [Boundaries](./boundaries.md) determine where we act.
* [Events](./events.md) alter our path or goal.
* [History](./history.md) helps us learn from the past.

## Directional

Our journey from where we are to where we want to be.

* [Bearings](./bearings.md) define where we are, where we want to be, and where we do not want to be.
* [Criteria](./criteria.md) validate that we have arrived where we want to be.
* [Consequences](./consequences.md) describe what happens after we have arrived.

## Relational

Our connections and interactions with others.

* [Actors](./actors.md) can influence our path or goal.
* [Terms](./terms.md) abstract experience and help us communicate.
* [Dependencies](./dependencies.md) define what we require of or provide to others.

## Operational

Our actions and what governs them.

* [Capabilities](./capabilities.md) define action.
* [Resources](./resources.md) grant action.
* [Constraints](./constraints.md) restrict action.
