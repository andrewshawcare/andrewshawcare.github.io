## Environmental

The landscape and how it changes over time.

## Directional

Our journey from where we are to where we want to be.

* [Criteria](./criteria.md) validate we have arrived at the goal.
* [Consequences](./consequences.md) show us where we can go next.

## Relational

Our connections and interactions with others.

* [Actors](./actors.md) can influence our path or goal.
