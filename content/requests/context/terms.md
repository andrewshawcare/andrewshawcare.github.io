## Concepts

How we think about our journey.

* What processes need naming?
* What abstractions need concrete definition?
* Where do definitions conflict or overlap?

## Language

How we communicate with others.

* What technical terms apply?
* What jargon do experts use?
* Which acronyms and abbreviations matter?
* What specialized meanings differ from common usage?

## Understanding

How different actors interpret key terms.

* Which terms mean different things to different actors?
* Where have misunderstandings or strong reactions occurred before?
* What assumptions hide behind common terms?
* How do cultural differences affect interpretation?

## Comparison

How we relate experience to motivate understanding.

* What analogies help explain our work?
* Which metaphors do others use?
* What mental models guide thinking?
* How do these comparisons help or mislead?

## Boundaries

How we decide what we communicate.

* How do we define success and failure?
* Where are the edge cases in our definitions?
* What is explicitly not included in key terms?
* When do definitions need to be precise vs. flexible?

## Publication

How we document our terms and who controls access.

* Where are definitions documented and who can access them?
* Who has authority to define or change terms?
* Which definitions are negotiable?
* How do we handle competing definitions?
