> What is the cost of refinement?

## Accuracy

How exact our work needs to be.

* What level of accuracy is required?
* Where must we be exact?
* Where can we approximate?
* What's the cost of imprecision?

## Tolerance

Acceptable variations from the ideal.

* What deviation is acceptable?
* Where is zero tolerance required?
* What ranges are permissible?
* How do we handle borderline cases?

## Validation

How we ensure precision.

* How do we verify accuracy?
* What checks must we perform?
* Who validates the precision?
* When do we test accuracy?

## Measurement

How we quantify precision.

* What units do we measure in?
* What benchmarks apply?
* How do we calibrate?
* What defines "correct"?

## Consistency

Precision across multiple instances.

* Where must everything match exactly?
* What variations are acceptable between instances?
* How do we ensure uniformity?
* What templates or standards apply?

## Documentation

How accurately we record our work.

* What level of detail must we capture?
* How precise must our records be?
* What can be summarized?
* What requires exact documentation?
