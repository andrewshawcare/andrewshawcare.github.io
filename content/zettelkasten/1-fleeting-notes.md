# Fleeting notes

[How to take Smart Notes](https://amzn.to/3WIicl0) describes three types of notes:

* Fleeting notes
* Reference notes
* Permanent notes

Fleeting notes are used to record thoughts as soon as they happen. At a later time, they are compiled into permanent notes and discarded.

The etymology of _fleeting_:

> early 13c., "fickle, shifting, unstable," from Old English _fleotende_ "floating, drifting," later "flying, moving swiftly," from present participle of _fleotan_ "to float, drift, flow" (see **fleet** (v.)). Meaning "existing only briefly" is from 1560s. Related: _Fleetingly_. [1]

_Shifting, unstable._ A thought from the past does not hold the same meaning in the present. Memory is imperfect and imaginative. Supporting context may be lost.

_Floating, drifting._ Thoughts move through our consciousness. They are brought into and out of the limits of our memory.

_Flying, moving swiftly._ If we don't perceive them, attend to them, and cultivate them, thoughts may come and go without record.
