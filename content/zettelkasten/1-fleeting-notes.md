_Fleeting notes_ are used to record thoughts as soon as they happen. At a later time, they are compiled into [permanent notes](./3-permanent-notes.md) and discarded.

The etymology of _fleeting_:

> early 13c., "fickle, shifting, unstable," from Old English _fleotende_ "floating, drifting," later "flying, moving swiftly," from present participle of _fleotan_ "to float, drift, flow" (see **fleet** (v.)). Meaning "existing only briefly" is from 1560s. Related: _Fleetingly_. [1]

_Shifting, unstable._ A thought from the past does not have the same meaning in the present. Memory is imperfect and imaginative. Supporting context may be lost.

_Floating, drifting._ Thoughts appear in our consciousness as they are brought into and out of the limits of our attention and memory.

_Flying, moving swiftly._ We must attend to useful thoughts before they disappear from our perception.
