1. When an interesting thought is had, write a [fleeting note](./1-fleeting-notes.md).
2. If the thought is related to something, record it in a [reference note](./4-reference-notes.md).
3. Use fleeting notes and reference notes to write [permanent notes](./2-permanent-notes.md).
4. Each permanent note should be [identified](./6-identifying-notes.md) and [catalogued](./5-cataloguing-notes.md) in the note box.
