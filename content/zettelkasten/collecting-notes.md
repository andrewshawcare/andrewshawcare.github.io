1. When an interesting thought is had, write a [fleeting note](./fleeting-notes.md).
2. If the thought is related to something, record it in a [reference note](./reference-notes.md).
3. Use fleeting notes and reference notes to write [permanent notes](./permanent-notes.md).
4. Each permanent note should be [identified](./identifying-notes.md) and [catalogued](./cataloguing-notes.md) in the note box.
