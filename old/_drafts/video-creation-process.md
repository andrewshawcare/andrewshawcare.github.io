# Video creation process

## Script

### Mind-mapping

* Map mind map to video and article

  When creating a mind map, it's useful to keep the hierarchy created for navigating content, either in text or video.
  
  * Markdown to YouTube description timeline application

    Given a Markdown file with heading hierarchy, create a text description with placeholders for video timestamps
  
  * Jekyll markmap plugin (or something)

    Create a tool that allows you to take the Markdown content of an article and produce a markmap from it with links to the headings (using fragment identifier links with the hash)

Mind mapping can be used to think through the process as well as to create a "video" or "article" map of the content.

I should create an application that produces a YouTube description with timestamp markers (unfilled) and titles (filled). It would allow for YouTube videos to have annotations for each section of the video and links to go to those places.

Eventually the timestamps may be automated either by reading the transcript, slide title, or some audio marker.

### Research

* ChatGPT
* Google

### Outline

* Order mind map
* Add new sections
* Rearrange sections

### Write

* Timebox writing
* Do not edit yet
* Do not attempt to organize or summarize

### Summarize

* Read and annotate article
* ChatGPT summary
* Read ChatGPT summary and write out what was removed (to study)

### Reference

* Jekyll plugin
* Associate research with article

## Visualization

* Experiment with visualization tools
  * D3
  * manim
  * webgpu

### Developing

* Test-driven development
* Eventually refactor common tooling

### Styling

* Use consistent styling for all tools/visualizations
* Keep it simple

## Shooting

* One take, redo on the fly
* Consider visual elements when shooting to allow for easier editing (e.g. animation will reduce the cuts that can be had)
* Make logo and intro animation

### Narration

* Get better audio
* Learn how to mix audio (find a great course on this)
* Learn about how to tell a great story
* Learn what makes Morgan Freeman and David Attenborough so compelling to listen to (vocal quality)
* Learn how to capture interest in opening

### Editing

* Complete Davinci resolve tutorials
* Figure out if metadata for timeline can be added directy to video in standards-compliant way

## Upload

* Create application to allow for formatting and upload to different sites

### YouTube

* Have the upload timing of YouTube videos dictate the release to other platforms
* Make YouTube short

### LinkedIn

* Use the YouTube description as the post (with links to YouTube and the web site added)

### Twitter

* Make a shorter version of the description? Is that still necessary? Upload entire video?

### Instagram

* Make shorter video based off timeline annotation (Introduction annotation?)

### Vimeo?

See if Vimeo might be useful

## Retrospective

* Add "Went well", this can be useful for videos and reminder of what I want to keep
* Make sure each action item has a "to improve" associated
* Make GitHub tasks for each action item
